troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who 
see things differently. They're not fond of rules, and they have 
no respect for the status quo. You can quote then, disagree with 
them, glorify and vilify them. About the only thing you can't do 
is ignore them because  they change things. They push the human 
race forward. And while some may see them as crazy, we see genius Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."

"People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing and it's
totally true. And the reason is because it's so hard that if you don't, any
rational person would give up. It's really hard. And you have to do it over a

sane, right? Who would want to put up with this stuff if you don't love it?"

up."
